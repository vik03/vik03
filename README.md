I'm full stack software developer/ consultant from India.

My primary tool is HP NNMi and worked on various monitoring tools like Nagios, Zabbix, Naemon etc.

I developed many Integrations on HP Tools like HPSM and HPNNMi and write various cross-platform plugins for Nagios and Naemon

I am very enthusiastic in learning new technologies.

I have been building APIs, Portals and tools for Machine Learning and data systems with different teams and organizations.

I like to build things with Deep Learning/Machine Learning, distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL databases, Postgres, Docker, Python, JavaScript, modern backend APIs, and modern frontend frameworks focusing mainly on Vue3
